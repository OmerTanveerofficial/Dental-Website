    <br>
    <p class="ap1" > In 1999, my father, Dr. Mark Gladnick, asked me whether he needed to put his practice on “The Internet.” We launched his first dental website a month or two later, and it worked well for a long time. By late 2007, my dad’s website looked outdated. Since I had moved on with my career, my dad began reaching out to some for bids on what it would cost to update his website.
<br>
        It seemed outrageous to receive quotes approaching $35k for just a website – and this wasn’t even taking SEO or PPC marketing into account! I decided to rebuild his website for free. Almost immediately after starting development on my father’s new dental website, two of my uncles (also dentists) got wind of this and asked if I could make them websites, too.</p>

        <p>Applying some of the techniques I had learned in Silicon Valley working on enterprise web applications, I came up with an idea: write one piece of software that would work for all three dental websites. We could customize each dental website with unique text, pictures, and so forth, but under the surface, everything would run on the same code.
<br>
            At this point, a few of my uncles’ friends, who were also dentists, began approaching me, asking me if I could help them, too. It seemed like I had a budding business on my hands. A handful of dentists wasn’t enough to make me quit my day job, but it certainly made me think about it.
            <br>
            One day my phone rang 4 times at work. A few days later, I surprised my boss by telling him I was quitting my job to “make dental websites.” A few months later I moved the company to Denver.
         <br>   
            I’m proud to say that we’ve worked with over 900 dentists in 7 countries to help them market their practices online, and we consistently add to our client base. We’re looking forward to the future and helping all of our customers continue to grow and expand their practices.</p>
